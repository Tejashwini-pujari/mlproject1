# Customer Segmentation ML Project

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project performs **Customer Segmentation** using **KMeans clustering**.  
The goal is to group customers based on **Annual Income, Spending Score, and Purchases Per Month** to identify patterns and create **targeted strategies**.

---

## 📊 Dataset
- 100 customer records  
- Features:
  - `CustomerID` : Unique identifier  
  - `AnnualIncome` : Customer’s yearly income  
  - `SpendingScore` : Score assigned by company based on customer behavior  
  - `PurchasesPerMonth` : Number of purchases per month  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-Learn (KMeans)

## ⚡ Key Steps Performed
1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**  
   - Loaded CSV dataset into a Pandas DataFrame  
   - Checked for missing or inconsistent values  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualization**  
   - Visualized distributions of features  
   - Checked correlations between features  
   - Pairplots to understand feature relationships  
3. **Clustering with KMeans**  
   - Applied KMeans clustering algorithm  
   - Trained the model to identify optimal clusters  
   - Visualized customer clusters using scatter plots  
4. **Testing & Analysis**  
   - Checked cluster distribution  
   - Analyzed characteristics of each cluster  
   - Identified patterns like high-value customers, budget buyers, and occasional shoppers
